# What is love?

"How do you know you are in love?"

My opinion is that we can't know if it's love until infatuation wears off. Until the pheromones aren't stronger than the reality and the walls are all starting to come down. Some people mask too much, some not enough, you need to know their mindset, values and ideals as intimately as their body. If you still imagine wanting to be with that person every day after the honeymoon phase is over in 3-6 months, and can imagine growing with that person, challenging, moulding and building one another up, then it's probably love. If all your mental deficiencies are balanced with each other, and you can successfully overcome the roadblocks and get better at it as you go, it's probably love. For me, I try to imagine as well, if something happened and they could not be intimate for the rest of their lives, would I still be here, would I be in this? Would my life be enriched? and if the answer is yes, I know I am in love.  
I believe there are a lot of people you can feel better off with than not and still not be in love. It's deeper than that. Settling can lead to a lot of investment and then heartache if we just look at love superficially as a matter of how we feel in it; I agree that it's a first step, but maybe not THE step. If you are going to build a life with someone, you need to love all the various parts of them: their minds, their perspective on life, values, their character, all of it. There are too many failed relationships and divorces in the world because people were quick to not be lonely, quick to assuage feelings of emptiness and just went with the good feels. Superficial happiness wears off eventually, substance goes the distance.
